Matlab and Octave code for the GPseudoRank method presented in 

Magdalena E Strau√ü, John E Reid, Lorenz Wernisch; GPseudoRank: a permutation sampler for single cell orderings, Bioinformatics, , bty664, https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty664

A tutorial is provided in .mlx, .m and .pdf format in the files GPseudRankByExample.mlx (inside GPseudoRank folder), GPseudRankByExample.m (inside GPseudoRank folder) and GPseudRankByExample.pdf. A version for Octave (not yet optimised for computational speed)can be found in the Octave folder.
